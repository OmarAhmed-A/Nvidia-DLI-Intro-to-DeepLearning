# Experiments in DL and TL

[NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute Certificate](https://courses.nvidia.com/certificates/5d58177d4fb040e2afbf8aca6deb30db/)

This project was part of an Nvidia Deep Learning Institute course at American University in Cairo. The project involved experimenting with deep learning and transfer learning using Python, TensorFlow: Keras, and deep learning concepts.

## Features

- Created a Convolutional Neural Network to classify images of hands showing Asl letters
- Augmented Training Images to increase variety and prevent overfitting
- Created an LSTM model to generate news headlines based on a given text
- Prepared a pre-trained model called ImageNet for transfer learning
- Retrained ImageNet to detect the presence of a specific dog from a photograph
- Trained and fine-tuned hyper-parameters to reach an accuracy of 97%
- Retrained ImageNet to identify rotten fruits from good ones reaching an accuracy of 96%
- Trained and fine-tuned hyper-parameters to reach an accuracy of 96%

## Technologies

- Python
- TensorFlow: Keras
